Data type:	A data type is used for to declare a variable and if you want use any variable,that variable should be intilised

data type classified int two types those are
1.primitive.
2.non-premitive.

now we discused about premitive data type: 
*premitive data types are predefined in java and premitives are always numbers.

the premitive data type again classified into 8types those are
and these all are start with loweCase when we have to start with capital laters they should comes under non premitive data type(wrapper classes)
1.byte 2.short 3.int 4.long 5.float 6.double 7.char 8.boolean

in this starting 6data types are also called as correspnding data types.
and in that 6 data types first 4 handled numerical values and remaining 2 data types handled realnumber nothing but(decimal values).
**By default all numerical values consider as int data type
**By default all decimal values conider as double data type

** if we are not intilised the variable by default numerical values takes zero and real numbers take 0.0
**if are not  not intilised the variable char takes by default space and boolean takes false

Non-primitive Data Types:
** these are not predefined in java.These data types are used to store multiple values.
**The default value of non-primitive data type variable is null.
**non premitive data types can be used to call methods to perform certain oeration
non-primitive data types classified as fllows:
1.Class
2.Object
3.String
4.Array
5.Interface
